JavaScript Problem-Solving Exercises
Overview
This repository contains a collection of 100 JavaScript problem-solving exercises focused on arrays, objects, strings, and variables. The problems are designed to enhance logical thinking and practical coding skills, inspired by platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank. They range from beginner-friendly to advanced, covering real-world use cases and a variety of algorithmic challenges.
Structure

Easy Problems (1-10): Beginner-friendly exercises introducing basic operations on arrays, objects, strings, and variables.
Medium Problems (11-50): Intermediate challenges involving sorting, filtering, merging, and deeper manipulations.
Hard Problems (51-100): Advanced problems requiring complex algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques.

Problem Format
Each problem includes:

Title: A concise name for the problem.
Description: Explanation of the task and its purpose.
Input: Expected input format, type, and constraints.
Output: Expected output format and type.

Topics Covered

Arrays: Sorting, filtering, mapping, reducing, merging, flattening, chunking, and advanced algorithms like sliding window and dynamic programming.
Objects: Key-value operations, nested object handling, merging, flattening, and transformations.
Strings: Parsing, formatting, searching, replacing, and advanced string algorithms like edit distance and run-length encoding.
Variables: Scope management, transformations, and optimization techniques like memoization and debouncing.

How to Use

Clone the Repository:
git clone <repository-url>


Navigate to a Problem:Each problem is documented with its description, input, and output requirements. You can find them listed in this README or in separate files (if implemented).

Solve the Problems:

Create a JavaScript file for each problem.
Write your solution and test it against the provided input/output examples.
Use Node.js or a browser console to run your code.


Test Cases:

Refer to the input constraints to create your own test cases.
Ensure solutions handle edge cases (e.g., empty arrays, invalid inputs).



Example Problem
Problem 1: Reverse a String
Description: Given a string representing a user's input message, reverse it to create a simple encoded version for basic data obfuscation in a chat app.Input: A single string (e.g., "hello"), length between 1 and 100 characters.Output: The reversed string (e.g., "olleh").
Getting Started

Prerequisites: Basic knowledge of JavaScript (ES6+ recommended).
Tools: Node.js, a code editor (e.g., VS Code), and optionally a browser for testing.
Resources:
MDN Web Docs for JavaScript references.
LeetCode or HackerRank for similar problem-solving practice.
